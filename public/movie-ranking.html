<h1>Josh's Movie Mania</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movie Picks of All Time</h2>
<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. 
Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting 
Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) 
and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's 
new home.</p>
<p>This movie opened up endless possibilities around space and time travel, the theory of relativity and the essence of an 
    unbreakable bond and how it affects reality around us.</p>
<h3>Star Trek Generations</h3>
<p>In the 23rd century, the Starship Enterprise is dispatched to the scene of a giant energy field about to engulf two ships. 
    Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) averts calamity, but is exposed to the field and presumed dead. Years later, the Enterprise's 
    new commander, Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), learns that one of the disaster's survivors, Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), 
    plans to enter the field by destroying a neighboring star. Picard now must collaborate with an unlikely ally in order to stop him.</p>
<p>Growing up with Star Trek I loved this movie as it brought together my favorite series characters, the sound was amazing for its time 
    and the whole feel of the Enterprise D felt even more futuristic.  The ending was summed up by a statement from the Captain that are 
    words to live by “I believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because 
    it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived.”</p>
<h3>Ghost Busters</h3>
<p>Who ya gonna call!  Need I say more..</p>
